## Technology Selection

### Language
We selected **[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)** for its simplicity, readability, and strong library support. It allows our team to develop quickly and maintain clean, efficient code.

### Framework
We’re using **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)**, a lightweight Python web framework that’s easy to set up and ideal for small-to-medium web applications. It provides flexibility and works well with SQLite for backend integration.

### Storage Plan
Our project uses **[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/docs.html)** as the database. It’s file-based, easy to implement, and perfect for local development. Data persists across sessions without requiring a separate database server.

### Operating Environment
Development will be done using **Some IDE we decide on** on **Windows** and **macOS**, with **GitHub** for version control and team collaboration.

### Summary
**Stack:** Python + Flask + SQLite
