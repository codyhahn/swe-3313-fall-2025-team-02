## Technology Selection

### **Programming Language**
We selected **[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)** as our primary programming language due to its simplicity, readability, and strong ecosystem of libraries. Python supports rapid development and produces clean, maintainable code, making it well-suited for both backend logic and data handling.

### **Web Framework**
Our application is developed using **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)**, a lightweight and modular Python web framework. Flask offers flexibility in routing, templating, and integration with databases, allowing us to efficiently build a scalable and maintainable web application.

### **Database Management**
We use **[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/docs.html)** as our database solution. SQLite is a self-contained, file-based database engine that requires no additional setup or server management. It supports persistent data storage, straightforward schema design, and integrates seamlessly with Flask through Python’s built-in sqlite3 module or SQLAlchemy.

### **Development Environment**
All development and testing are performed using **[Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** on **Windows**. Version control and collaboration are managed through **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, enabling efficient branch management, pull requests, and code reviews among team members.

### **Technology Stack Summary**
**Stack:** Python • Flask • SQLite  
**Tools:** VS Code • GitHub • Git  
**Operating System:** Windows
